##Known Issues
-Firefox Users will have issues with the white font text in the textboxes.

-The theme is not yet compatible with Gnome 3.20 and GTK 3.20.

Note:
If you would like the GTK 2.0 applications to be dark also, you can go to the gtk-2.0 folder and rename gtkrc to gtkrc_bak. Then, rename gtkrc_dark to gtkrc. Then, follow the installation procedures below. There are a few compatibility issues with the gtk 2.0 dark theme, so you may want to stick with with the original gtkrc.

## Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. "/usr/share/themes/"
Alternatively, extract it to the ".themes" directory in your home folder if you want the theme to be applied only to you user.

Use a theme changer such as Gnome Tweak Tool, Ubuntu Tweak or LXappearance to change the the theme to Centauri
